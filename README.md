Research into Sudoku to make a board with partially filled numbers, we have to start with the a full board until there is one or more solutions.

Generate a Sudoku Mat
Fill it with 0s

Generate a random number of 1-9 implicit
Check if that number can be added to grid in the location of the nested for loop
Add a number 1-9 (implicit) to the location if it can be added

Static list of 1-9, shuffle it with Collection.shuffle or whatever
Put it in row 0 then iterate to another shuffled row
    check if row, col, and sqaure are valid
